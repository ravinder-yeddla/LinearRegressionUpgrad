# Mutltiple LinearRegression project
## The problem statement
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues. They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.  

- How well those variables describe the bike demands  

The model should be built and evaludated for the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## Approach to problem solving
Below are the steps involved in solving this Bike sharing demand modeling project
1. Understand the given data set
2. Cleaning and analyzing the data
3. Preparing the data for model building
4. Building the Multiple linear regression model
5. Validating this against Training and Testing data
6. Statistical measurement R2 of this model against test set
